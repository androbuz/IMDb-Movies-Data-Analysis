# IMDb-Movies-Data-Analysis
## Introduction
This is a project I completed while studying Data Analytics on Udacity.
## What's in it?
Data analysis of about 10,000 movies having user ratings, revenue, budget and genre among other columns from 1960 to 2015.
I tried to explore what makes a movie successful and what makes a movie a failure. I specifically analysed successful movies' trends comparing them to unsuccessful movies to make informed and precise conclusions.
